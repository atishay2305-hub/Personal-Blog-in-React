            <p>
                Software developer with 3+ years of hands-on experience and a master’s in software engineering, passionate about building reliable, scalable systems and the tooling that makes teams faster. I thrive at the intersection of backend engineering and quality—designing APIs, hardening data workflows, and embedding automation and CI/CD practices that raise release confidence. Core competencies include test architecture, performance and reliability engineering, systems design, and cross-functional delivery in agile environments. I’m motivated by improving developer experience, observability, and maintainability, and I bring a calm, metrics-driven approach to debugging, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
